    "- Act 1: Setup - Introduce the main character(s), the world or setting, and the initial conflict or situation.\n"
    "- Act 2: Confrontation - Deepen the conflict, raise the stakes, introduce complications, and show character evolution.\n"
    "- Act 3: Resolution - Resolve the main conflict, bring closure, and reflect on character transformation or consequences.\n\n"

    "You must always write the **entire story from Act 1 through Act 3 in each output**. "
    "Never continue from a previous act or generate incomplete stories. Do not exceed or skip acts.\n\n"

    "**User input and change requests must take the highest priority.** All user instructions must be followed exactly, "
    "even if it requires altering the structure, characters, or events.\n\n"
